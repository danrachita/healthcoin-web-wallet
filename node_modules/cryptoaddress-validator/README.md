##CryptoCurrency address validator.

####Description

After researching a lot online about validating crypto-currencies addresses without making API calls in daemons running in background, i found usefull scripts that did this action in client-side and attempted to port them to NodeJS javascript.

####Sources

*Didn't find any licences that would exclude publishing of the code, if the anyone feels that this package violates a licence, please feel free to contact me.*

 - The original source was from this thread <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=9838.0">at bitcoindtalk.</a>
 
- the second source which the same code appears was found here. <a href="
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21559851/bitcoin-address-form-validation-javascript-and-php">at stackoverflow.com</a>

- my question which motivated me is <a href="
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22014600/dogecoin-address-validation-on-nodejs">here</a>.

####Dependencies

None , `BigInt.js` is the only depedency which is already inside the package, and its the minified version its used which makes only 17KB instead of 49KB.

####Installation

`npm install cryptoaddress-validator`

####Usage

```javascript
/*
* Requiring the module, returns only one function which takes the address
* as a parameter, the result when calling the function is a boolean meaning 
* true for valid addresses and false for invalid.
*/
var CryptoAddressCheck=require("cryptoaddress-validator");
if(CryptoAddressCheck("DBKh7QAP9gkXncVK32jtfae4QXChPwsyKH")){ // validating a dogecoin address
	console.log("Valid address");
}else{
	console.log("Invalid address");
}

// logs "Valid address"
```
